# 🧪 Alloying Script — Alloy Addition Optimization Tool

A Python-based tool designed to **optimize alloy compositions** by calculating the best combination and amount of alloying additions to meet desired material targets.  

This script can be used by metallurgists, material scientists, and engineers to find cost-effective or compositionally precise alloy additions for experimental or production processes.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Alloying Script** computes optimal alloying additions based on given constraints such as:
- Target chemical composition
- Available alloying materials
- Elemental bounds and limits
- Cost or composition accuracy objectives

It provides an **automated optimization solution** that replaces manual trial-and-error alloy balancing.

✅ Configurable elemental bounds and constraints  
✅ Extensible optimization algorithms (greedy / numerical / heuristic)  
✅ Modular Python structure (easy to adapt for new alloys)  
✅ Command-line or programmatic usage
