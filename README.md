# 🧪 Alloying Script — Alloy Addition Optimization Tool

A Python-based tool designed to **optimize alloy compositions** by calculating the best combination and amount of alloying additions to meet desired material targets.  

This script can be used by metallurgists, material scientists, and engineers to find cost-effective or compositionally precise alloy additions for experimental or production processes.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Alloying Script** computes optimal alloying additions based on given constraints such as:
- Target chemical composition
- Available alloying materials
- Elemental bounds and limits
- Cost or composition accuracy objectives

It provides an **automated optimization solution** that replaces manual trial-and-error alloy balancing.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Composition optimization for multi-element alloys  
✅ Configurable elemental bounds and constraints  
✅ Extensible optimization algorithms (greedy / numerical / heuristic)  
✅ Modular Python structure (easy to adapt for new alloys)  
✅ Command-line or programmatic usage

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- Typical dependencies (add these to `requirements.txt` if not already there):
  ```text
  numpy
  scipy
  pandas
  

  
  ## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/everprogrammer/Alloying_Script.git
cd Alloying_Script`

- Create a virtual environment
  `python -m venv venv`

- Activate the virtual environment
  Bash
  `source venv/Scripts/activate`

- Install dependencies with:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Script
Run the main optimization script from the command line:
`python main.py`

Expected Output (example):

Optimized Alloy Composition:
  Fe: 60.1%
  Cu: 24.8%
  Ni: 15.1%

Suggested Additions:
  Fe: 40g
  FeCu50_50: 20g
  Ni: 5g

## 🧮 Optimization Approach

  Depending on configuration, the script uses:
  
  Nonlinear optimization strategy to calculate the additions
  
  Modify or extend the core logic in optimization_strategy.py to suit your use case.
  
  ## ⚙️ Configuration

  Edit constants in constants.py:
  
  - Elemental bounds and tolerances
  
  - Default target compositions
  
  - Optimization step sizes
  
  You can override constants by command-line arguments or config files.

## 🧪 Testing

  If you add tests, use pytest or unittest:

  `pytest tests/`

### Recommended test cases:

  - Alloy with known composition solution
  
  - Invalid or extreme bounds
  
  - Randomized datasets for performance testing
